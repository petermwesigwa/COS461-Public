Question 1) Approximately how long into the simulation (seconds)
            is the DNS reflection attack detected? 
            How can you tell this from the DNS response rate plot?

Answer 1) About 600 seconds into attack

Question 2) With what probability does your implementation drop 
            DNS response packets to perform rate limiting?

Answer 2) 0.9

Question 3) Why did you choose this probability? 
            How does changing this probability affect
            the DNS response rate plot? (Re-run the experiment
            with different probability values if you are not sure). 

Answer 3) Changing the probability changes the slope of the graph but not by much. 
            I decided to use a very high probability of 0.9 to heavily minimize the traffic 
            from hosts that are suspected to be running DNS attacks.

Question 4) What components of the detection/mitigation technique used in this assignment
            may not be optimal for real-world deployment? 
            Choose one and explain how it could be improved.

Answer 4)   Keeping a hash table containing all the mappings of ip addresses to requests   
            might not be practical in the real world as each middlebox would likely be  
            tracking a large number of hosts that would have many entries in such a hash 
            table.

Question 5) DNS reflection attacks are of real concern in the global Internet, 
            but a general solution that does not involve updating all
            connected hosts at once has yet to be found. 

	    Think about the reasons why DNS reflection attacks are possible 
            (e.g. what does the attacker do, what does the DNS resolver do, 
            what causes the victim to be negatively affected). 

            Pick one of these reasons and brainstorm methods to prevent it, 
            thereby preventing DNS reflection attacks 
            (even if these methods require a complete Internet upgrade). 

            Describe the reason you chose and a possible prevention method
            you came up with.  

            This question is intentionally open-ended and will be graded leniently. 
            Try to be concise yet thorough. 

Answer 5)   Attackers are able to spoof the victim's address because there is no system
            that prevents one end host from putting another end host's IP address as the
            source of a packet. I propose adding a check in each local area network where 
            before sending out any DNS packet, a router checks to ensure that the packet 
            contains the right source IP address. This would prevent the attacker from  
            mislabeling its DNS packets with the IP address of the recipient.
